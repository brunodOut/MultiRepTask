The files named:
- tug_template.png
- wug_template.png
are both based on an early copyrighted work by Jean Berko Gleason.

I have ommited those files on this repository because I only had her written
permission for the usage of her work on my research only, meaning I do not have
permission for redistribution. 

You can either replace the original images by any drawing you own, however you
MUST:
- Use a white background, AND
- The drawing filling must be transparent
Otherwise the random background color won't work as expected.

You can also contact Mrs. Gleason and obtain permission to use her drawing, yet
you will have to adapt the images of the original drawing to correspond to
those above mentioned instructions anyway.

Sincerely,
Bruno Moreira-Guedes <moreira.guedes@estudante.uffs.edu.br>
