# MultiRepTask
MultiRepTask is the code for an experiment aiming to test whether identical
real-world information my be represented through multiple different cognitive
frames (or multiple schemata, depending on the way you approach the problem).

## Working Principle
The test aims to "produce" cognitive framins on participant's mind through
category learning and association of categories, using repetitive
differentiation tasks. Once "formed" the cognitive frames, we will test
whether identical stimuli will be classified at chance, when ambiguous (no
contextual cue exhibited), and according to the stimulated frames, when
indirect information (contextual cue) is exhibited.

# Progress
The test is currently a work-in-progress, at the middle of its development.

## Roadmap
Implemented Sessions:
- Namu-Bonho Differentiation Learning
- Wug-Tug Differentiation Learning

TODO Sessions:
- Olbar-Zilnar Differentiation Learning
- Olbar-Wug-Namu x Zilnar-Tug-Bonho Association Differentiation Learning
- Multiple Representation Test with ambiguous stimuli
